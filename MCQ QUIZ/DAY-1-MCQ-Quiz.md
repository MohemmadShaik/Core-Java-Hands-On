## Q1. What is the main role of the JVM?

✅ **Correct Answer:** C  
**Executes bytecode and manages runtime memory**

🧠 **Why?**  
JVM is responsible for executing bytecode, handling memory, garbage collection, and runtime execution.

❌ **Why others are incorrect?**  
- A: Writing code is developer’s job  
- B: Bytecode is generated by `javac`, not JVM  
- D: Compilation is done before JVM comes into play  

---

## Q2. What is the output generated after compiling a Java program?

✅ **Correct Answer:** B  
**Bytecode**

🧠 **Why?**  
The Java compiler converts `.java` files into platform-independent `.class` bytecode.

❌ **Why others are incorrect?**  
- A: JVM creates machine code at runtime  
- C: Java does not expose assembly code  
- D: Java does not generate `.exe` files  

---

## Q3. Which command is used to run a compiled Java program?

✅ **Correct Answer:** B  
**java ClassName**

🧠 **Why?**  
The `java` command launches the JVM and executes the bytecode.

❌ **Why others are incorrect?**  
- A: `javac` is only for compilation  
- C: `jvm` is not a valid command  
- D: Invalid syntax  

---

## Q4. Java is platform independent mainly because of:

✅ **Correct Answer:** C  
**JVM availability on different platforms**

🧠 **Why?**  
Same bytecode runs on any OS that has a JVM.

❌ **Why others are incorrect?**  
- A: OOP has no relation to platform independence  
- B: Memory management is unrelated  
- D: Performance doesn’t ensure portability  

---

## Q5. Which component performs Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation?

✅ **Correct Answer:** C  
**JVM**

🧠 **Why?**  
JIT compiler is part of JVM and converts bytecode to native machine code at runtime.

❌ **Why others are incorrect?**  
- A: JDK is a development kit  
- B: JRE is a package containing JVM  
- D: Java compiler works before execution  

---

## Q6. Which is the correct execution flow of a Java program?

✅ **Correct Answer:** B  
**.java → .class → JVM**

🧠 **Why?**  
Source code is compiled to bytecode, then executed by JVM.

❌ **Why others are incorrect?**  
- A, C: Wrong order  
- D: OS does not execute Java source code  

---

## Q7. Which memory area stores class metadata and method definitions?

✅ **Correct Answer:** C  
**Method Area**

🧠 **Why?**  
Method Area stores class-level information like methods and static data.

❌ **Why others are incorrect?**  
- A: Heap stores objects  
- B: Stack stores method calls  
- D: Registers are CPU-level  

---

## Q8. What happens when you run `java HelloWorld`?

✅ **Correct Answer:** B  
**JVM loads bytecode and executes `main()`**

🧠 **Why?**  
JVM loads the class and starts execution from `main()`.

❌ **Why others are incorrect?**  
- A: Compiler is not invoked  
- C: OS does not run Java source code  
- D: GC runs when required, not first  

---

## Q9. Which statement about Java is TRUE?

✅ **Correct Answer:** C  
**Java is both compiled and interpreted**

🧠 **Why?**  
Java code is compiled to bytecode and interpreted/executed by JVM with JIT.

❌ **Why others are incorrect?**  
- A: Java is not only interpreted  
- B: Java fully supports OOP  
- D: JVM is mandatory  

---

## Q10. Why is `main()` declared as static?

✅ **Correct Answer:** B  
**To allow JVM to call it without creating an object**

🧠 **Why?**  
JVM needs an entry point and cannot depend on object creation.

❌ **Why others are incorrect?**  
- A: Performance is not the reason  
- C: Inheritance is unrelated  
- D: Garbage collection is independent  

---

## Interview Takeaway (Day 1)
- JVM vs Compiler responsibility is a common interview trap
- Platform independence = JVM, not OS
- Java follows compile + run execution model
